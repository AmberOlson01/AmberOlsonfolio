            <h1> Psychology Honors Thesis</h1>
            <p> My thesis examins using games as an alternative
            to self-report personality assessments to predict
            job performance. My methods includes a self-report
            survey items on the Big Five Personality traits and
            data from my participant's Grand Theft Auto player
            profile.  As of now, I predict that game assessments
            will be more accurate in predicting job performance.
            as compared to self-report survey items.</p>

            <h1>A.D.V.A.N.C.E. CSUSB</h1>
            <p> Amber Olson spent her summer in an intensive10-week
            research program funded by the CSUSB Office of Student 
            Engagement. This team investigated Science, Technology, 
            Engineering, and Math (STEM) disparities in recruitment, 
            retention, promotion, and tenure for female and minority 
            faculty members on the CSUSB campus.  This research, led
            by Dr. Donna Garcia, will be used to apply for a series 
            of grants, including a one million dollar ADVANCE grant 
            from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The team completed
            literature searches, coded large data files, developed stimuli
            for an implicit bias test, conducted experimental research with
            human participants, developed a surveys via Qualtrics, and
            gained experience with research software such as SPSS and
            Zotero.  Through these activities, the team identified some
            gender and ethnic disparities on the CSUSB campus in the 
            recruitment, hiring, retention, promotion and tenure processes.
            These disparities are particularly pronounced in the STEM 
            disciplines at CSUSB. The focus of our future research will
            be to determine the sources of inequities at CSUSB and develop
            an intervention for them. </p>
